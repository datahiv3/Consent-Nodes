# Consent Nodes

## Overview

The **Consent Nodes** in the DataHive ecosystem are responsible for managing user permissions and ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations such as GDPR. These nodes handle user consent, ensuring that data is only shared or processed according to the user's preferences.

## Features

- **User Consent Management**: Handle permissions for data usage across the DataHive ecosystem.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure that all data processing adheres to global privacy regulations.
- **Decentralized Control**: Users retain full control over their data, with the ability to revoke or modify consent at any time.
